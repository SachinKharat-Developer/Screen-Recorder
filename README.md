# üìΩÔ∏è Screen Recorder in Python

# Description:

A lightweight and efficient desktop application developed using Python that enables users to record their screen activity in real-time. The application captures the screen along with audio and saves the recording in a video format, making it useful for creating tutorials, recording meetings, or gameplay.

# Key Features:

Fullscreen and custom area recording

Audio capture (optional)

Real-time screen frame capture using pyautogui and OpenCV

Video export in .mp4 or .avi format

Simple and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter

# Technologies Used:
Python, PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, NumPy, Tkinter, Pyaudio, MoviePy

# Outcome:
This project helped me deepen my understanding of Python libraries, real-time video processing, and GUI development, while solving a practical real-world problem.
